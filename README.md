See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_play for the gist.

Usage
-----

The board is hard-coded into resara.pl, so edit and run it:

    $ perl resera.pl
    Player Column:  (100.000000%, 0.000000%)
    Player Row:     (100.000000%, 0.000000%)

TODO
-----

* expand summary
* take the board as command line arguments
* ouput the board
* maybe make the code less ridiculous?
* add a fun license
